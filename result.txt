desirable charge potential profile, excellent cyclability, and
good safety feature since the invention of lithium ion re-
chargeable batteries in the early 1990s. However, its low
theoretical capacity (372 mAhg−1) cannot satisfy the in-
creasing requirements of the electronic devices and electric
vehicles to the batteries. Besides, the drawbacks related to
graphite, such as cointercalation phenomenon of solvent
molecules and anisotropic structure feature, limit its electro-
chemical performance. The former can result in exfoliation
of graphite and thereby cause the consequent destruction of
the graphite structure. This prevents the use of small mole-
cule solvent with high ionic conductivity. The latter restricts
the random diffusion of lithium ions into the graphite struc-
ture. Both of them limit the rate capability of graphite anode.
Moreover, large initial irreversible capacity loss is another
serious problem for graphite anode, which is mainly caused
by the complex and imperfect surface structure, such as sp3-
hybridized carbon, carbon chains, and edge carbon [1].
Many works have been carried out to improve the electro-
chemical performance of graphite anode, such as employing
smaller particles [2], preparing graphite/nanopowder com-
posite [3–5], and oxidizing or purifying the graphite [6–9].
Recently, a lot of research findings have confirmed that
cycling performance and rate capability can be improved
by surface coating with amorphous carbon [10–13].
Abstract Artificial graphite anode material was modified
by coating an amorphous carbon layer on the particle sur-
face via a sol-gel and pyrolysis route. The electrochemical
measurements demonstrate that appropriate carbon coating
can increase the specific capacity and the initial coulombic
efficiency of the graphite material, while excessive carbon
coating leads to the decrease in specific capacity. Thick
coating layer is obviously unfavorable for the lithium ion
diffusion due to the increased diffusion distance, but the
decreased specific surface area caused by carbon coating is
beneficial to the decrease of initial irreversible capacity loss.
The sample coated with 5 wt.% glucose exhibits a stable
specific capacity of 340 mAhg−1. Carbon coating can re-
markably enhance the rate capability of the graphite anode
material, which is mainly attributed to the increased diffu-
sion coefficient of lithium ion.

Introduction
Artificial graphite (noted as AGP) has been widely used as
an anode material for lithium ion batteries due to its
Compared with graphite, amorphous carbon has an iso-
tropic feature, which enables lithium ions to transport inside
randomly and thereby exhibits a good rate capability. Be-
sides, amorphous carbon shows minor volume change dur-
ing charge/discharge process [14, 15] and thus has a good
cyclic performance. Therefore, surface modification by
coating amorphous carbon is as an effective approach to
improve the electrochemical performance of graphite. Re-
cently, many works have been reported, which focused
mainly on the effect of carbon precursor [16, 17], coating
